    <h1>SummaNote Extension Test Page</h1>
    
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure the SummaNote extension is loaded in Chrome</li>
        <li>Select the text below (highlight it with your mouse)</li>
        <li>You should see a SummaNote tooltip appear</li>
        <li>Click the tooltip to see the summary popup on the RIGHT SIDE</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Test Text to Select:</h2>
    <p>
        Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. The term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving".
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The scope of AI is disputed: as machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. A quip in Tesler's Theorem says "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet." For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.

    <h2>Debug Information:</h2>
    <p>If you don't see the tooltip, check:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Open Chrome DevTools (F12)</li>
        <li>Go to Console tab</li>
        <li>Look for "Content script loaded!" message</li>
        <li>If you don't see it, the extension isn't loading properly</li>
    </ul>
    
    <script>
        // Add some debugging
        console.log("Test page loaded");
        
        // Listen for selection events
        document.addEventListener('mouseup', function() {
            const selection = window.getSelection();
            const text = selection.toString().trim();
            console.log("Text selected:", text, "Length:", text.length);
        });
    </script>
